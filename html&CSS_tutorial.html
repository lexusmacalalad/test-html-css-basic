    <h1>Accessibility</h1>

    <!-- Lists -->
    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <h4>Unordered lists</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Unordered list 1</li>
        <li>Unordered list 2</li>
        <li>Unordered list 3</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- divs -->
    <div>

    </div>

    <!-- Images -->

    <!-- image 1 with the class bigger linked from internal CSS -->
    <img class="bigger" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Amanita_muscaria_%28fly_agaric%29.JPG" alt="mushroom">

    <!-- image 2 with the class smaller linked from internal CSS -->
    <img class="smaller" src="https://mario.wiki.gallery/images/3/3e/MPSS_Mario.png" alt="Mario">

    <p>Images are considered as an "in-line block", meaning that the element will always take up space on the same line, as long as it can fit the screen like the images above.</p>
